# Nestfall

It is unfortunate and unneecessary to have to learn things the hard way, by making mistakes.  Fortunately, we can learn from the experience of others so we don't have to!  Nestfall is an opinionated, community-managed goldmine of knowledge-learned-the-hard-way.

Here you can find guides to get you started, help you avoid pitfalls, and make the most of your time.
