# Home Buying

## Don't be fooled
Buying a home is a large investment.  Many houses for sale will have newly rennovated kitchens and bathrooms and sometimes shiney new appliances.  Don't be fooled, surface-level rennovations and new appliances are some of the least relevant things to consider when evaluating the value of your investment.  Most of the value of your home will be in the land, location, frame of the house, roof, foundation, water and electrical system, and square feet of the floor plan.  Shiney kitchens and bathrooms are nice-to-haves but they wont make the 100k, 200k, 300k price tag worth it.  Be sure to evaluate the house overall, and don't put too much weight in it's gilding.

## Things to check for
None of these things should necessarily prevent you from purchasing a house, but each of them is important to check for so that you truly know what you are buying, if it's worth what you are paying for and what problems you'll be dealing with in the next 1-5 years.
- Integrity of the roof
- Condition of major appliances
    - Heating / Furnace
    - Air Conditioning system
    - Water Heater
    - Refridgerator
    - Stove / Oven
- Has the basement flooded in the past or is the house located in an area that may flood in the future?
- Are the gutters set up properly to move water away from the base of the house when it rains?
- Lead
    - Lead paint
    - Lead water main
        - It is important to know the lead levels in the water coming into your house.  Even if there is a lead main, you can ameliorate it with filters for drinking water.  Even if the water main isn't made of lead it is best to get your water tested.
    - Lead can be a significant health hazard, especially to children and infants
- Foundation integrity
    - Look for cracks in the foundation if it is a block foundation
    - Look for cracks in the walls near the corners of doorways on the upper floors (this is a bad sign)
- Radon
- Mold
- Noise
    - Is the home located too close to train tracks or other industrial sites?
- Light pollution
    - Light streaming in your windows at night can make it hard to sleep.  This can be easily fixed with light-excluding curtains but it is worth noticing anyway.
- Sunlight
    - This is more of a plus.  Do you like the positioning and size of the windows in the house.  How will their orientation bring in light (either desireable or undesireable) at various times of day?
- Does the floor bow or creak
- Signs of termite or ant damage?
- Is the electrical system set up properly?  Are necessary outlets grounded?  Does the electrical panel use GFCIs, AFCIs, or have a whole-house circuit breaker?
    - Some of this is optional, but the more up-to-date the better because the correctness of the electrical system can be a safety concern.
- Does the laundry dryer vent outside and is it unobstructed? (It absolutely must)
